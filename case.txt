### Instruction:

Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

### Response:  
First find the number of eggs remaining after Janet eats three for breakfast: 0 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day = <<16-3=13>>13 eggs/day
Then find the number of eggs remaining after she bakes the muffins: 13 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = <<13-4=9>>9 eggs/day
Then divide the number of eggs remaining by the number of eggs sold per day to find her total sales: 9 eggs/day / 2 eggs/day = $<<9/2=4.50>>4.50/day
