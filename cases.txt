Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:

Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

### Response:  
First find the number of eggs remaining after Janet eats three for breakfast: 0 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day = <<16-3=13>>13 eggs/day
Then find the number of eggs remaining after she bakes the muffins: 13 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = <<13-4=9>>9 eggs/day
Then divide the number of eggs remaining by the number of eggs sold per day to find her total sales: 9 eggs/day / 2 eggs/day = $<<9/2=4.50>>4.50/day

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

### Response: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 0*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed.
If the chickens are fed in three separate meals, then Wendi gives her chickens 15+25=<<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed per day.
For the final meal of the day, Wendi needs 60-40=<<60-40=20>>20 cups of feed.

### Instruction:
Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?

### Response: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 2*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed.
If she feeds her chickens in three separate meals, then in the final meal, she will need 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of feed.
